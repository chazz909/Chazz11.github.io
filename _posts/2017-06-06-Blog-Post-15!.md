This blog will be over 4 separate 30 minutes of working on code academy. This will mean I will have 4 separate paragraphs.

**Part 1:**

I started this session on number 9 (moving on) on pyglatin. I was stuck on this for a while, but when I found out what it was, I managed to finish the whole of pyglatin which went all the way up to 11, but 9, 10 and 11 were all very hard and I reckon I probably spent more time then 30 mins on it but hay ho.

**Part 2:**

I started functions this session and i got all the way up to 10, I found this pretty easy so there is not much to write about. But still got another hour of work to do! :(

**Part 3:**

For this 30 minute session, I did functions 11 all the way through to the end 19. This was challenging but I did get it all done. I got through this very quickly which I'm really happy about and kind of proud about!

**Part 4:**

This was my last session and I completed all 7 codes for "take a vacation." Not much to talk about on this one, got it done nicely.
