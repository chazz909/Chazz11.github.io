**Year 9 Lesson 5**

**In Lesson 5 of year nine doing google sheets, we made discount codes. First we made a discount page on the sheet. So to recap we now had Order form ,Stock sheets, profit and loss,costs , sales and now discount codes.**

**We made 3 discount codes for different amount. For example I did : XZ = 5% discount, YZ =10% and ZZ=15% off. Then on the order from we made a Subtotal, delivery, Vat ,grand total and Disscount. We had to make the coding so that if their was a discount the google sheets would automatically take away the discount percentage from the subtotal meaning also the grand total would change**
