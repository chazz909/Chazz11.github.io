**Year 9 Lesson 6**

**Today was our last lesson before half term. We didn't learn anything new on google spreadsheets but did get given time to just make sure ours was working and up to speed.**

**Instead we were talking about supercomputers and how easily thrust could hack passwords. A average password is 8 characters  long. There's a certain amount of characters you can use in a password including numbers and letters. It could be any of those for any of the 8 characters. So we worked out how long it would take to get the password and what the probability was that I'd would get it first time.**

**For the remainder of the Lesson like I said earlier , we got time to refine are blogs and spreadsheets. I am not sure if we are carrying on with spreadsheets when we come back after half term but I would say I've enjoyed using spreadsheets even tho I've found it very difficult.**
