**Year 9 Lesson 2**

**In today's lesson we carried on using google sheets learning more interesting things. We have 2 sheets, An order form for when someone orders saying what they want, the quantity and the price. The other one is the stock sheet which had the code,what type of clothing, quantity ,cost price and sale price which we had  to work out.**

**We did this by writing the amount of profit we wanted to make. I put 35%, we then timesed  it by how much the clothing cost to get (sale price) and then added that as well. This meant we knew how much are clothes needed to be to be able to make 35% profit.**

**Then we made it so that when an order came through just buy the codes e.g SJ for supreme jumper. Automatically google sheets would say how much the individual price is.**
