**_Year 9 Lesson 4_**

**In today's lesson we did not have our normal teacher, we had a cover teacher and cover work. However we were still used google sheets so it wasn't that much different to our normal lessons.**

**In this week's lesson we had to add 3 new pages to our spreadsheets. The new titles that we had to add were, Sales, Profit and Loss, and Costs. We didn't have to add anything to Profit and Loss or Sales however we did have to make a table on costs.**

**We had to make a table on what we think would cost our company money. I put staff wages , rent, and electricity bills. I then worked out how much it would cost me for each of those 3 costs ; Per Hour, Per Day and Per Year and finally a total sum it would cost my company ( all 3 cost per year.)**

**I am really enjoying using google sheets and making up my own company. This is because we get a lot of freedom as our company can sell whatever we like. Also it's good practice for the future as some of us might own a company or a business when we are older.**
