**Year 9 Lesson 3**

**I was not in the lesson this week. However I went to IT club on Monday to catch up. What they were doing in class was carrying on from the lessons before.**

**I used Vlookup. It meant that when I write the code of the clothing, the  name of the clothing came up. Also if I then put the quantity In, the individual and total price would appear in the table.**

**I have found google sheets really hard. However I have persevered and kept going. I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things with google sheets.  However I've caught up with all the work I've missed and have done the homework. The homework was to research other titles we could use in are stock and order form. I added: Discount code,Profit,Income, expenditure and income tax.**
