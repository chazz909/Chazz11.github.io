    <td>My partner(karun) and I learned how to set up the FUZE box through a booklet Sir gave us, as well as giving us all the tools. We started with simple coding, such as making it say hello world one time and other times at different speeds. Me and Karun were very happy with the rate we were working at and it was extremely rewarding.</td>
