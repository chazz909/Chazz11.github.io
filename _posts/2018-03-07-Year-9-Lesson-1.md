**Year 9 Lesson 1**

**Using Google Sheets**

**Today was our first lesson of IT in year 9. We are learning how to use google sheets as it will help us with coding.  We started by getting taught the easy tools like making a table and changing the colour of it. Also if you select a column and go on functions you can do things to all the numbers selected like: find the sum, the average, the minimum and the maximum.**

**We then made our own company that sold something. Mine sold clothes,shoes and watches. You had to make 4 boxes. The first said what clothing and brand it was , the second said the quantity (how many) of the clothing. The 3 one said how much it cost to buy  1 and the 4 said the total amount.**

**Then we made a different table with the same clothes but with a different table with only 1 column. This column had a different price for how much it cost to buy one. We saved that and using vlookup transferred that onto   our other sheet.**
